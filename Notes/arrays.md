## What is an Array?
An array is a data structure that stores elements of the **same data type** in **contiguous memory locations**.

Each element can be accessed using an **index**.

## Why Do We Need Arrays?
- To store multiple values under a single variable name
- Faster access using index
- Better organization of data
- Used as a base for advanced data structures

## Types of Arrays
1. **Static Array**
   - Fixed size
   - Size must be known in advance

2. **Dynamic Array**
   - Size can grow or shrink
   - Example: Python List
